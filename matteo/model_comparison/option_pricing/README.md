# ESN/M2 option-pricing benchmark

First milestone: review and diagnose the preserved ESN engine before building
M2 option pricing. See [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) for code/report inconsistencies.
See [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) for the three initial diagnostic runs and their limits.
No original ESN sources or historical experiment records are changed.

The dated M2 SPX prototype and common price targets are now implemented. See
[M2_SPX_RESULTS.md](M2_SPX_RESULTS.md) for the unfitted diagnostics; conditional
VIX pricing and joint fitting remain open.

```sh
python -m matteo.model_comparison.option_pricing.m2_spx \
  --refinement-factor 4 --output /tmp/m2_spx_coupled_new
```

This reads training quotes at 29/57 days only. It does not calibrate or access
held-out prices for scoring. The copied preprocessing flags and numerical
diagnostics must accompany any interpretation of its output.

From the repository root, with NumPy, SciPy and pandas installed:

```sh
python -m unittest matteo.model_comparison.option_pricing.test_benchmark -v
python -m matteo.model_comparison.option_pricing.benchmark \
  --output matteo/model_comparison/option_pricing/runs/report_rounded_smoke_001
```

The default budget (512 SPX paths, 32 VIX outer draws, 64 inner continuations,
500 burn-in days) is a smoke diagnostic, not calibration-quality evidence.
Use `--parameters reference` for the exact entry-point starting vector;
`report-rounded` uses the approximate final vector printed in the report.
Both preserve the actual executable target selection and weights. Explicit
CSV paths are available through `--spx` and `--vix`.

Each new run directory contains `run.json` and `points.csv`. Existing output
directories are refused. No optimization is launched and no claims about
matching the published optimum follow from this command. Larger-budget runs
must refine outer/inner counts and strike integration separately, use fresh
seeds, and report failed prices as well as surviving-point errors.

The implementation sequence remains the one in the
[M2 calibration plan](../../exogenous_reservoir_eq_m2/documentation/CALIBRATION_PLAN.md):
reproduced ESN benchmark; common audited targets; dated M2 SPX pricer;
conditional M2 VIX pricer; joint fitting; physical-fit and held-out evaluation.
